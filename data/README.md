Traits
======

Monocots
--------

- Traits are obtained from BIEN database.
- Useful is probably **height** and **growth form** (Specific leaf area and Seedmass are just added)
- Growth form is **woody** (trees, shrubs, lianas) and **herbaceous** (herbs, epiphytes,Vine) 
- Prior publication - need to contact Kristine Engemann-Jensen from Svenning group, she compiled the 
  original growth form data. 
- There are much more height values in TRY database (573 (bien) vs. 1537 (try)) - if needed, I can 
  illegally give you the extra valus but we would need an offical proposal to publish the results. 
- There are likely some mistakes in the trait database (e.g. Annannas is classified as Tree...)

Mammals
-------

I extracted traits from Elton traits, Pantheria and Anage traits. Attached is the file with 
accepted mammal names and synonyms, perhaps useful when linking with supersmart taxonomy.
