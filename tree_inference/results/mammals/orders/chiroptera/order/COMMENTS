Both consensus and final trees are ultrametrisized before calibration step. 
Fossil points match better to these trees than to non-prior ultrametrisized trees. 


** A phylogeny for the order has been already reconstructed.As mentioned above the artificially ultrametricized tree
match better to fossil points than the non-artificially ultrametricized tree. For this reason i break down the order in two suborders and one family. As soon as these trees are not ready its better not to use the ultrametricized tree for further analysis.
