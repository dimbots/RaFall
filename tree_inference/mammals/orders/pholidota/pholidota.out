*** WARNING: please read the section on OpenMPI performance at
http://www.nsc.liu.se/systems/triolith/#mpi before using OpenMPI on Triolith! ***

This module was built with the Intel compilers version 12.1.4 and will most
likely work only with Intel compilers. To be reasonably certain this OpenMPI
version works with the software you build, please also use the compilers of
version 12.1.4.

This is the multi-threaded MPI hybrid variant of ExaBayes (version 1.4.1),
a tool for Bayesian MCMC sampling of phylogenetic trees, build with the
Phylogenetic Likelihood Library (version 1.0.0, September 2013).

This software has been released in 2014-09-01 by 

	Andre J. Aberer, Kassian Kobert and Alexandros Stamatakis

Please send any bug reports, feature requests and inquiries to exabayes-at-googlegroups-dot-com

The program was called as follows: 
exabayes -f ./infer_backbone_57176-dat.binary -s 1234 -n infer_backbone_57176 -c ./infer_backbone_57176.nex -w . -R 4 -C 1 -M 0 

================================================================

The (binary) alignment file you provided, consists of the following
partitions:

number:		0
name:		NoName

Starting MCMC sampling using the AVX implementation for likelihood computations.
ExaBayes will run until topological convergence is achieved
(ASDSF < 5.00%, at least 100000 generations).
ExaBayes will print log-likelihoods of all chains, grouped by
run id (separated by '=') and sorted by heat (starting with the
cold chain). First column indicates generation number (completed
by all chains) and the time elapsed for this increment.
