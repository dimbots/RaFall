Monocots - traits are obtained from BIEN database
useful is probably height and growth form (Specific leaf area and Seedmass are just added)
growth form is woody (trees, shrubs, lianas) and herbaceous (herbs, epiphytes,Vine) - prior publication - need to contact Kristine Engemann-Jensen from Svenning group -she compiled the original growth form data
there are much more height values in TRY database (573 (bien) vs. 1537 (try)) - if needed, I can illegally give you the extra valus but we would need an offical proposal to publish the results
there are likely some mistakes in the trait database (e.g. Annannas is classified as Tree...)


Mammals
I extracted traits from Elton traits, Pantheria and Anage traits
attached is the file with accepted mammal names and synonyms, perhaps useful when linking with supersmart taxonomy
